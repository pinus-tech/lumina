## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**

<img alt="Christian" src={useBaseUrl('/img/cca/commit/christian.jpg')} style={{maxWidth: '250px'}}/>

- Name: Christian Steven Jonathan
- Current Role: co-Director
- Past Role: Training Manager
- Testimony: As part of the Training Team for two years, I found joy and satisfaction in teaching software to NUS students. As much as I enjoy teaching in workshops, commIT has provided me with so many opportunities to grow in other aspects as well, like the chance to work in publicity. I had so much fun working with multiple event committees while picking up new skills along the way. Most importantly, I met so many wonderful people, made new friends, and felt a sense of belonging in NUSSU commIT.

**Testimonial #2**:

<img alt="Wilson" src={useBaseUrl('/img/cca/commit/wilson.jpg')} style={{maxWidth: '250px'}}/>

- Name: Wilson Wongso
- Past Role: Operations and Logistics Manager
- Testimony: commIT is a place where I opened myself to non-Indonesians and also made a family with them. I started as a Welfare cell member and stepped up to be an Ops Director and along the way, I improved a lot in my communication skills, especially conversing in English. As an Ops director, I learnt to be more organised and accountable to others and myself as I helped organise training sessions for new members and improving NUS computer centres. I also made a lot of friends, not just Indonesians but also Singaporeans, Chinese, and even Malaysians! So come join commIT guys!
