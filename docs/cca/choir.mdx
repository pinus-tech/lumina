## About CCA
The NUSChoir is a cca under the centre for the arts (CFA). It is a place where people with a passion and interest for choral music come and sing together under the guidance of Mr. Nelson Kwei.


## Why Should You Join?
1. Learn more about choral music
Besides singing the pieces, we also learn more about the different genres and styles of music. Furthermore, there are free vocal training that comes within the CCA to maximise your learning experience in the choir.
2. Form lasting friendship
The NUSChoir is a great place to bond and form lasting friendship as there are many bonding activities placed by the committee, for eg. Choir Camp, Carolling, Halloween Party and etc. 
3. Go on subsidised international tour
The NUSChoir was awarded the “Choir of the World” in 2018 after participating in the Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales. We go on tour abroad almost every year, hence it will increase your exposure to the culture of the people abroad. 


## Activites/Events
Usually there will be 1 small concert partnering with external parties during Sem 1. In Sem 2, the NUSChoir has its own concert called the “Varsity Voices”. During December, there will be Christmas carolling in public places to gather the fund used to subsidise international tours.

- Testimony: As a freshman, I was very glad that the people in the choir is very welcoming and warm. I am not a very outspoken person, but the seniors gladly spark conversation with me. It is also nice that most of the time, after practice, we will eat supper together and bond. Music wise, the vocal training really helped me a lot to sing better. The Section Leaders are also very knowledgeable and approachable whenever I encounter difficulties.

- Testimony: I would recommend NUS Choir as it is the only place in NUS where you can sing a mix of the modern, classical and folk all in one place! They can also have a learning environment where it will be conducive in picking up new skills in regards to our singing and music, something all of us who join are looking for.
