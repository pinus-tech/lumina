## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**
- Name: Hans Alnando
- Past Role: President/Chapter Director 
- Testimony: My experience has been tremendously great! I have been volunteering in the organisation for over 2.5 years now since my freshman day at university. It was an eye-opening exposure to skills-based volunteering, seeing how much value-add a student can give by applying his career skills for social good organisations. It definitely sparks the volunteering side in me that I honestly did not have much experience in given my only occasional involvement in more 'hands-on' volunteering activities in previous years.

**Testimonial #2**:
- Name: Jovita Suryawinata
- Past Role: Trainee 
- Testimony: One thing that differentiates Conjunct Consulting from other consulting clubs at NUS is the thorough training sessions and hands-on workshops that it provides (it actually helps for some of my consulting interviews!). Additionally, being surrounded by a like-minded community with driven individuals across different faculties and years really help to expand my network.
