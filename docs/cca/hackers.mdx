## About CCA
NUS Hackers (https://nushackers.org) is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture and free, open source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things, be it for charity, business or pleasure. We also hold workshops, run technical meetups, organize hackathons, and maintain open source code for the NUS community.


## Why Should You Join?
NUS Hackers is run by a group of student volunteersâ€”the coreteam. Our long term goal is to build a healthy community of passionate hackers in NUS. We think that this benefits everyone: start-ups, tech companies and professors have a central pool from which to find good programmers, and students have an easy way to meet and learn from like-minded peers.


## Activites/Events
We organise events that support our mission of spreading the hacker culture.

During the semester, our primary events include:
- **Friday Hacks** (https://www.nushackers.org/fridayhacks): weekly meetups every Friday that include one or two technical talks, sometimes followed by a hacking session;
- **Hacker Tools**: workshops on Tuesdays that cover skills that are essential to those in computing fields but are not usually taught by schools; and
- **hackerschool** (https://school.nushackers.org/): workshops on Saturdays called hackerschool that cover a range of technical topics, and are aimed at introducing technologies to those who have no prior knowledge.

We also run **Hack&Roll** (https://hacknroll.nushackers.org/), the largest student-run hackathon in Singapore, which is usually held near the start of each calendar year. Hack&Roll is unique for being one of the few hackathons, if not the only, that do not have a set topic for participants; instead, the aim is to simply encourage people to come and have fun building something.

We also run smaller events for the NUS community:
- **Project Intern**, where students who have interned share with others their experience and the benefits they have gained from interning, in a bid to encourage others to intern.
- **OpenHack** (https://openhack.nushackers.org/), to encourage students to contribute to open-source projects.


## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**
- Name: Steven Wijaya
- Current Role: Coreteam Member
- Testimony: This organization does what it says almost everywhere, i.e., spreading the hacker culture. I feel that it gives a great exposure to those who are interested in learning things that are not taught in school. If you are not sure whether this is for you, just try to attend our events first :)

**Testimonial #2**
- Name: Julius Putra Tanu Setiaji
- Current role: Coreteam Member
- Testimony: I absolutely had a great experience in the coreteam, organising events to spread my love for the hacking culture. While it takes a lot of effort to organise these events, it is definitely worth it to see people start to build their own projects!


## How to Sign Up?
To join our events, you can just come on the specified dates and times that are usually announced on our online platforms. We also usually ask people to RSVP for our events so we can gauge the number of participants and provide resources before the event itself. For the upcoming semester, since all of our events will be online, do look out for further announcements to get the webinar links.

If you are interested in joining the core team, do look out more about this when the semester starts. We usually begin to process the applications in the first several weeks of school.

Feel free to email us at coreteam@nushackers.org if you have any questions :)
