## About CCA
The Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association is a group of aspiring tertiary students that aims to promote **volunteerism** and **environmentalism** among youths and is currently established globally. When the association was first formed in Taiwan, Master Cheng Yen, the founder of Tzu Chi Foundation, had three points of advice to the youths: firstly, do Tzu Chi’s work during the spare time; secondly, cultivate a heart of compassion for people; thirdly, learn to get along with different types of people.


## Why Should You Join?
The future of world development depends on the values and directions of modern youths, and college is an important stage of professional and personality development. The ideals and ambitions of university students and their grasp of humanistic values will have a considerable impact on the roles they play in the future.

With the spirit of loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and selfless giving, and the goal of nurturing a generation of youths whose hearts are filled with human love and compassion, the Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Associations around the world gather local tertiary students to take part in various Tzu Ching activities and serve the needy in society.

As an NUS Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association member, you get the chance to unleash your youthful enthusiasm and work for the greater good of humanity.
