## About CCA
Established in 1976, the NUS Students’ Engineering Club is the official faculty club and sole union representative of all undergraduates in the Faculty of Engineering. Engin Club, as it is popularly known, is highly regarded for its vital role in the academic and social lives of about 6,000 full-time Engineering undergraduates, working closely with the faculty administration to provide the best for our fellow students.

Each academic year, a new Management Committee is elected to facilitate the various activities that seek to enhance the students’ experiences beyond academic pursuits. Besides being the voice of the student body, Engin Club strives to connect to all Engineering undergraduates through our vibrant initiatives and collaboration with the other engineering subsidiary clubs and societies, as well as the faculty department.


## Why Should You Join?
Engin Club, being the highest club in NUS Engineering provides an opportunity for students to have a say and create initiatives that can impact the entire faculty’s well-being, student life and academic programmes. It offers a chance to step into the student body of NUS and NUSSU Constituent Clubs, allowing you to develop skills and necessary understanding in organizing events.

## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**
- Name: Stanley Jeremy
- Current Role: Student Life Cell - Head of Programmes
- Past Role: NIL
- Testimony: I joined Engin Club as a way to gain exposure as well as make the livelihood of students better. Joining the Student Life Cell as the Head of Programmes, I was working closely with the President, VP Student Affairs and Director of Student Life in bringing up programmes for Engin Day, Engin Lepak Week and E-genium (NUS Engin SLF). In doing so, I also have a chance to liaise with OSA and the Student Life advisors. Throughout the entire experience, I have learnt many things from creating a proper proposal to manning an event catered for nearly 900 students at once, as well as coming up with suitable programs to allow Engin Club improve their ability to reach out towards more students. I really enjoyed the experience so far despite the occasional stress sometimes haha but, it was all worth it when you managed to make the Vice Dean of Engineering playing legos during Engin Day as if he was back to his childhood days and how he was really enjoying the programmes I came up with. It is certainly once-in a lifetime experience and can only be experienced now when you are in Uni. Join Engin Club if you wish to find new friends and have a say in what’s going on in your faculty!
