## About CCA
NUS Symphony Orchestra is an orchestra under NUS Centre for the Arts which welcomes students with musical talents from any faculties to join. It aims to develop an education-centric youth orchestra committed to the pursuit of excellence and to make classical music more accessible and relevant.

**Symphony in the Park**
NUSSO also conducted several performances in Botanical Gardens, which is also free of charge! It is an exciting experience to play surrounded by nature.

**Miniatures**
In NUSSO, you are encouraged to step out of your comfort zone and get to know other musicians from different sections as well! Miniatures give you the chance to perform with these new-found friends in a smaller group (2-4 people!)

- Name: Hans Sebastian Mulyawan
- Current Role: Violin II
- Past Role: Violin II
- Testimony: I love music, I love violin, I love NUSSO. In NUSSO, everyone encouraged you to become a better musician. With the guidance of Mr Lim Soon Lee and Mr Foo Say Ming, we are moulded to listen to one another and to play the orchestra as a coherent team. The musical pieces that we performed are also challenging yet still enjoyable to practice. And, I also love the white suit by NUSSO hehehe. All in all, it is fun to be on stage, and knowing that the efforts put are worthwhile!


## How to Sign Up?
There will be an audition to test your capabilities in playing your chosen musical instrument! You will need to prepare your sight-reading skills and one piece to showcase the conductor. Donâ€™t worry, he is too kind to bite you!
