## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**

<img alt="Archangel Quinterra" src={useBaseUrl('/img/cca/angklung/angel.jpg')} style={{maxWidth: '250px'}}/>

- Name: Archangel Quinterra
- Current Role: President
- Past Role: Director of Communications
- Testimony: I do admire the notion of togetherness embedded in playing the angklung. As one angklung produces the sound of a particular note, it takes a village (figuratively, though) to produce a graceful performance. Thus, the unity and meaningful friendships I have made through angklung propelled me to step up as president and be the spokesperson to invite more members of the NUS community into angklung’s loving community. 

**Testimonial #2**

<img alt="Christian Drake Martin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/cca/angklung/drake.jpg')} style={{maxWidth: '250px'}}/>

- Name: Christian Drake Martin
- Current Role: Vice President
- Past Role: Vice Project Director, Senandung Angklung 2020
- Testimony: Joining NUS angklung in my first year was one of the best decisions I made because it was not only about how well the members played the angklung, but also about the friendship and the togetherness. At first, I thought only Indonesian songs could be beautifully played with angklung, but when I heard “The Greatest Showman” played with it, it was really amazing and graceful. These made me want to show Angklung to the NUS community even more and step up as VP. 

**Testimonial #3**

<img alt="James Yaputra" src={useBaseUrl('/img/cca/angklung/james.jpg')} style={{maxWidth: '250px'}}/>

- Name: James Arista Yaputra
- Current Role: Advisor
- Past Role: Student Conductor
- Testimony: 
  This year will mark my fourth year in Angklung. My experience in the ensemble has been nothing short of wholesome and memorable. Not only do I get to make music, but I also get to forge lasting friendships with various people along the years.

  I spent the first year as a regular member, just coming once a week to shake bamboos. What I look forward to the most was making music together with my friends. You see, playing the Angklung is very different from playing other instruments. Since an Angklung can only play a single note, you would have to be able to coordinate with other ensemble players to make coherent and beautiful music, which is the charm and challenge of playing the Angklung.

  From my second year onwards, I’ve been the conductor of the ensemble. The experience is one of a kind to say the least. Conducting an ensemble of single-note instruments can be both very fulfilling and very frustrating.

  I wouldn’t trade my experience in Angklung for anything; the memories I made during my time spent in the ensemble are some of the most memorable during my time in university.
