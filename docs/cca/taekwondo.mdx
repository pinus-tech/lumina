## Testimonials
- Name: Ronald Santoso
- Past Role: Member
- Testimony: Joining NUS Taekwondo was one of the tough decisions I have made in university as I have to step out of my comfort zone and venture into something unknown. As someone who is not very confident in sports, I felt taekwondo has given me the chance to exercise amidst my sedentary lifestyle in university. I have also met friends who did not have any background, but picked up interest in taekwondo in NUS. Thanks to all these people, I managed to train hard and learn to appreciate the beauty of this martial art, as well as relieve some stress as I take a break from studying.
