## About CCA
NUS Archery is a sports CCA under both TeamNUS and NUS Sports Club. NUS Archery club serves as both a competitive sport for NUS (varsity) and recreational sport for **anyone with** or **without** prior experience in archery.  


## Why Should You Join?
For those without prior archery experience, joining NUS archery is a good way to try out a new sport. Archery is not only a sport which puts your strength to the limit, but also your mind as it is a mentally challenging sport. By joining archery, you’ll learn not only how to shoot arrows (up to 70m!), but also how to be calm under time pressure. Ultimately joining NUS Archery will give you that chance to look cool and feel cool while shooting that 70m distance. 

For those who are experienced and are looking to compete for NUS, you can join TeamNUS for archery and get varsity perks. For example, varsity athletes get the privilege of staying in UTown Residences for their stay. Another perk you can get is the windbreaker jacket, which of course you can show off to your peers.


## Activites/Events
Once school starts we would have a beginner’s course for you all later during week 3 and week 4. You will have a chance to shoot real arrows at real targets regardless of your experience! During the same time (week 2 onwards) you can try out our CCA training, which is usually done in the evening and learn what it takes to be a real archer. 

By the end of the year we would be having one of our bi-annual chalets! The purpose of having chalets is to strengthen bonds between fellow archers outside of training sessions ^^. 

The main highlight of our club is when we would be having NUS Indoors, which is our annual Indoor archery competition held in NUS. by joining, you get to experience real competitive archery. Of course there are other competitions you can join throughout the year such as NTU Indoors (NTUIAC)


## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**
- Name: Darren Erdyan Khalif
- Current Role: Logistics Deputy Head
- Past Role: member
- Testimony: When I tried out archery for the first time, I thought it was rather intimidating seeing all the archers down in the range. Turns out the journey to be an archer wasn’t that all scary. While the training is rigorous and tough, it’s not that bad sinceI got to make new friends along the way. The seniors are nice people too!! So you can just approach them for anything :)

**Testimonial #2**:
- Name: Aldo
- Past Role: Member
- Testimony: I agree with Darren that Archery was fun although the training is quite serious. This CCA is like a recreational activity which is good for you after you do all the academic stuff on the day as the training is usually at night.
