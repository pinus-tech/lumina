- Testimony: When I first joined the society, I was shocked by how friendly and welcoming the seniors are. Although I’m new to the Data Science field, I have gained a lot of insights about it through all the events that are organised, especially the workshops and career talks. Due to my previous roles, I’ve gotten the opportunities to communicate with reputable external parties as well, an experience I’ll never get otherwise. Despite career-related activities, I’ve also received a lot of valuable suggestions from the seniors who are always ready to answer my queries. Come join us if you want to find out more about Data Science like me!
