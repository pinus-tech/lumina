## About CCA
NUS Cuesports is a recreational sports CCA under NUS Sports Club. Cuesports, also known as billiard sports, are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick, which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to move around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by elastic bumpers known as cushions.


## Why Should You Join?
1. Learn more about playing cuesports regardless of your skills
2. Know other friends who share a similar interest in cuesports from various kinds of faculties

**Other benefits**
1. There will be gifts at the end of a semester if you attend most of the training sessions
2. The CCA will be held off-campus, so you will know more about pool halls in Singapore


## Activites/Events
Every year, NUS Cuesports holds weekly training sessions. In these sessions, trained players will teach the fundamentals of playing cuesports (bridge, how to aim, how to break, etc.). There will also be a friendly match at the end of each training session.

There will be two main events, 9 balls, and 8 balls. NUS students mostly play these competitions. Various prizes are available for winners of these competitions.


## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**
- Name: Austen Jeremy Sugiarto
- Current Role: Logistics Director
- Past Role: Member
- Testimony: When I first come to NUS, I didnâ€™t know there is a CCA for cuesports. However, I saw a banner promoting NUS Cuesports. I joined the first training session on AY19/20 sem 2, and the committees are very welcome to new students like me. Since then, I always joined the training session. I wanted to be an exco in Cuesports because I like cuesports and I like to try new experience.


## How to Sign Up?
You can come and join the training sessions as long you fill the weekly polls. You can join the telegram group:tinyurl.com/cuesportsrecre

To become an exco, there will be an election at the end of sem 2.
