## About CCA
NUS Korean Cultural Interest Group was established in 2009 to promote awareness of Korean culture among NUS’ student population. It strives to cultivate a deeper sense of appreciation towards Korean culture. NUS KCIG consists of Korean Cultural Society (KCS) and KCIG Dance Team (KDT). 

KCS organises activities that focus on the cultural aspect of Korea. Its activities are weekly sessions, hosting incoming exchange students from South Korea, and organising Buddy Program. Check KCS 2019 out: [NUS Korean Cultural Interest Group | KCS] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoTG_3I5ALw). 

KDT’s activities include dance covers and an annual concert. Check KDT 2019 mashup out: [NUS Korean Cultural Interest Group | KDT] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH70XvqfS2Y).

- Name: Ivy Husni 
- Past Role: Member
- Testimony: Throughout my 3 years in KDT, I’ve met a lot of friends who share the same interests as me. Practice sessions are never boring. Dance practice is definitely my stress reliever every single week. I am also grateful to have been part of its concert for 3 years, as performing on stage with friends has always been very fun and meaningful to me. I also love dressing up for concerts and dance covers, wearing outfits I would not usually go for. If you love Korean culture and/or Kpop,this interest group is perfect for you! There are lots of very skilled dancers and also lots of beginners too, so don’t worry if you have no prior experience.
