## Testimonials
- Name: Amelia Regina
- Current Role: Senior Member
- Past Role: Junior Member
- Testimony: I wasnâ€™t very active but I have joined a few workshops and learnt a decent set of skills for landscape and event photography. I joined photo booth events which were paid occasionally and did some event photography for performing arts CCAs. They were fun experiences, but I learnt the most is when I tagged along with senior members to a NUSSU exco shoot and saw how they conducted it. I also joined the mentorship programme as a mentee but unfortunately, the events were cancelled due to COVID.
