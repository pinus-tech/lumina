## About CCA
NUS ISE Club is a constituent club under NUS ENGIN Club (which is also under NUSSU) which serves as a platform to bond the whole cohort (Yes, you did not read it wrongly!) and as a bridge that connects students with professors. We proactively organize and innovate new events for the cohort to ensure that our events remain relevant to the cohort.


## Why Should You Join?
The benefits of joining are as follow, but not limited to:
1. Create your own legacy - by brainstorming new initiatives that are relevant for students, professors and partners!
2. Make more friends and establish connections with more people.
3. Learn to organize effective events through inputs from not only students, but also professors and external partners.
4. Learn to liaise with external organizations such as business & community partners.
5. Create a social impact on society.

P.s. itâ€™s a 2 year commitment! Surely you would grow a lot and make solid connections here!


## Activites/Events
NUS ISE Club holds various and constantly updated events such that it would be an onerous task to track each of them! However, you would certainly be a part of these annually - or even biannually - held events, which include: 
1. NUS ISE Business Analytic Case Competition
2. NUS ISE Freshmen Orientation Programme
3. NUS ISE Community Engagement Projects
4. NUS ISE Night Cycling
5. NUS ISE Club Bonding Sessions
And many more!
