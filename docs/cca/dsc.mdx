## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**
- Name: Matthew Alexander
- Current Role: Project Lead (Tech)
- Testimony: Being in DSC presents me with an opportunity that is unique to none. As the tech lead of the project, my work impacts real people that need these solutions the most. The experience offers an experience to ‘taste’ leading a software engineering project from gathering use-cases to develop the actual prototype. If you want to pick-up tech skills (UI/UX, Backend, Frontend), meet like-minded people & help those; definitely check out DSC NUS.

**Testimonial #2**:
- Name: Jovita Suryawinata
- Current Role: Project Lead (Business)
- Testimony: Interested in learning more about tech, I decided to join DSC and contribute with my business knowledge, and am glad to be partnered with my tech lead who is really keen in letting me learn and explore tech better. I feel that DSC is an inclusive and friendly community, in which non-tech students can connect with tech students and share their knowledge with others, whilst creating social impact together.
