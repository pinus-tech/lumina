## About CCA
Established in 1981 by Cultural Medallion recipient Mr Alex Abisheganaden, NUS Guitar Ensemble (GENUS) is the region’s first Niibori guitar ensemble. Previously comprising only classical prime guitars, GENUS was later modelled after the Niibori Orchestra in Japan, becoming the pioneering guitar ensemble in Singapore to showcase the distinctive and diverse musical possibilities of the Niibori method.

Under the directorship of our conductor Dr Robert Casteels, GENUS is proud to have performed a diverse repertoire featuring pieces from different musical cultures, ranging from major classical Western works to contemporary Japanese pieces. As a pioneer in the Singapore guitar ensemble scene, GENUS aims to uphold a strong musical standard befitting of our status, in order to set the benchmark of musical excellence for ensembles in Singapore while establishing connections with international ensembles. Moving forward, GENUS is working towards promoting a greater love for guitar ensemble music in Singapore so as to establish the guitar art form as an integral part of the local arts landscape.

In our pursuit of musical excellence and continued improvement, GENUS offers its members an environment that is both nurturing and challenging. Beginning with a structured workshop programme for newcomers, each member’s journey promises ample performance and learning opportunities — through our annual concerts, external performances and overseas exchanges. Notably, GENUS has embarked on tours to Japan and Germany, attained awards in local and international competitions, and performed for external events ranging from Esplanade’s In Youthful Company performance series to the ASEAN University Games.

## Testimonials
**Testimonial #1**
- Name: Stanley Jeremy
- Current Role: Member of Contrabass, Bass and Guitarron Section (Bass)
- Past Role: Member of Alto Section (Alto 2)
- Testimony: I have played in my secondary school guitar ensemble previously and have known NUS Guitar Ensemble for a while. I was already planning to join at least one musical group just to try and have a bit of fun in university. I ended up being in GENUS (Initially wanted to join NUS Wind Symphony but my saxophone was only loaned until the end of JC so I didn’t instrument to do so). However, I didn’t regret the decision to do so and actually enjoyed my time in GENUS a lot so far. Despite some challenges as I didn’t play guitar for 2 years (I played saxophone in JC haha) but, the musical choices and the seniors support actually gave me the motivation to be better every day. Our group may not be as big as NUSSO or NUSWS but, we are a closely-knitted group and despite coming from the various faculties of NUS, we are united by our love and appreciation for guitars. Come and join GENUS to witness how guitar can actually match the strength of an ensemble or even an orchestra and change your view of guitars beyond an individual-based instrument.
