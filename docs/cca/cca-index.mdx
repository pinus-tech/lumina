---

Now that you’ve applied for housing, selected your modules and finally arrived at NUS, what’s next? As Week 1 is approaching, sign-ups for CCAs, societies, clubs and interest groups are starting to open!

_Thinking of joining a club or CCA but still feeling unsure?_ Fret not! We have compiled a list of CCAs across different categories, along with contacts of seniors for each CCA who will help and guide you. You can freely drop them a message and ask any queries about the CCA or get them to share their experiences.

Lastly, don’t forget to check out the links for each CCA page to get to know more about each CCA. We will be hosting a sharing session for you to talk to these seniors firsthand, do keep a lookout!
