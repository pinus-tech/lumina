## [PGP House](http://nus.edu.sg/osa/pgphouse)

#### Why stay at PGP House?

- PH offers a flexible living option that allows students to focus on their studies instead of being required to spend their time in various Hall CCAs. This is especially favourable for those that tend to prefer alone time. 
- However, since PH is a new hall, you have a huge flexibility to pioneer something in PH. The PH ecosystem allows you to easily start an interest group and will be willing to provide support for you to start one. 
- PH also offers classes on selected General Elective modules, such as GER1000H (Quantitative Reasoning), which allows students to study and meet their university requirements in the comfort of their homes.

#### Culture / Focus

PH is a relatively new hall with a focus on Frugality and Sustainable Living. PH offers a more relaxed lifestyle as compared to other halls that place emphasis on Sports and Cultural activities. PH provides a flexible option for students to join CCAs within PH or outside of PH (other NUS CCAs). 

#### Duration

Entitled to 1 year of stay, if you want to extend your stay, you should prepare a portfolio consisting of your involvements in PH interest groups or NUS CCAs.
